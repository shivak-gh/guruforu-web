Research from cognitive science and educational psychology has identified specific study strategies that significantly improve learning outcomes. Here are 10 evidence-based tips that can transform how your child studies.",

      "title": "1. Use Active Recall Instead of Passive Review",
      "content": [
        "Many students think studying means re-reading notes or textbooks. However, research shows that actively retrieving information from memory is far more effective than passive review."

          "title": "What the Research Shows",
          "text": "Studies by cognitive scientists like Dr. Jeffrey Karpicke demonstrate that testing yourself on material—even before you feel ready—strengthens memory more than re-reading. This is called the 'testing effect' or 'retrieval practice.'"
        },
        {
          "title": "How to Apply It",
          "text": "Instead of just reading notes, have your child close the book and try to explain concepts out loud, write summaries from memory, or create practice questions. The struggle to recall information actually strengthens the memory."

      "content": [
        "Cramming might help you pass a test tomorrow, but it won't help you remember information long-term. Spaced repetition—reviewing material at increasing intervals—is scientifically proven to improve retention."
