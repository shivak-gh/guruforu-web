  "lead": "In today's fast-paced digital world, maintaining a child's focus while ensuring they learn through scientifically-proven methods has become one of the greatest challenges for parents and educators. At GuruForU, we believe that combining child-centered focus strategies with evidence-based learning approaches creates the optimal environment for academic excellence.",

      "content": [
        "Focus, or sustained attention, is the ability to concentrate on a task while filtering out distractions. For children, this skill is still developing and requires careful nurturing. Research from cognitive psychology shows that a child's attention span typically follows a pattern: 2-3 minutes per year of age. This means a 10-year-old can generally maintain focus for 20-30 minutes before needing a break.",
        "However, focus isn't just about duration—it's about quality. When children are genuinely engaged with material that matches their interests and learning style, they can maintain attention longer and absorb information more effectively. This is where personalized learning becomes crucial."

          "title": "1. Spaced Repetition",
          "text": "The spacing effect, discovered by German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus, shows that information is better retained when learning is spread out over time rather than crammed into a single session. This is why regular, consistent practice beats last-minute studying."

          "title": "2. Active Recall",

          "title": "3. Interleaving",
          "text": "Studies show that mixing different types of problems or subjects during study sessions improves long-term retention. Instead of completing all math problems of one type before moving to the next, alternating between problem types helps children develop deeper understanding."
