        "Class 10 board marks influence stream selection (Science, Commerce, Arts), college admissions, and scholarship eligibility. Maths is compulsory in most boards and often determines whether a child can pursue PCM (Physics, Chemistry, Maths) or PCB (Physics, Chemistry, Biology) in Class 11. Parents need to understand what's at stake—and how to support without adding pressure."
