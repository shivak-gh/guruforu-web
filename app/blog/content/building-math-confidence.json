      "content": [
        "Math anxiety is more than just disliking math. It's a feeling of tension, worry, or fear that interferes with working with numbers and solving problems. Research shows that math anxiety can reduce working memory, lower test scores, and lead students to avoid math-related subjects and careers—even when they're capable.",
        "Understanding that math anxiety is common and treatable is the first step. With the right support, students can learn to manage anxiety and build both skills and confidence."

          "text": "Students may avoid math homework, say they're 'just bad at math,' feel physically tense before tests, or freeze when asked to solve problems aloud. These reactions are often about anxiety, not ability."

        {
          "title": "Impact on Learning",
          "text": "When anxiety is high, the brain uses resources that would otherwise go toward solving problems. Reducing anxiety frees up mental capacity for actual math thinking and improves performance."

          "title": "It's Not Fixed",
